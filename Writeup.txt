The first thing we did was develop code for detecting text within the images. We made code that checked the red channel, blue channel, red channel, and all the channels altogether when looking for text. We analyzed the least significant bit, the second to least significant bit, and the third least significant bit when going all the channels. We made sure to cover the case of when text was encoded in both TBLR and LRTB formats.

For the image detection code, we made functions that could analyze any given bit of the red channel, blue channel, green channel, and all the channels put together and magnify the bit in question so we could see, visually, if it was likely that something was encoded in an image. From then on we made functions to get the header from either an individual channel or all the channels put together. Then a functions that try to find and extract a hidden image from another image. Text files were used as buffers for bytes, that represent a 0-255 color, in some of the code because we were worried about the number of bytes would overflow any data structure we could think of using.
