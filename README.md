Running Program in Terminal:
First you compile your .java files

`javac *.java`

then you run it by typing,

`java TextDetector hide_text.png`

`java ImageDetector hide_image.png`

where ImageDetector or TextDetector is the class 
with your main method and hide_text.png or hide_image.png 
is the input image, in the terminal.

The ImageDetector class has a method to inspect the bits in an image to see if another image is encoded in it and a method to get the hidden image.
